# adni_visualize

A 3D convolutional neural network to classify fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Images fall into one of three categories:cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Secondary goals: 
1. Investigate learned filter morphologies and overall manifolds at each layers
2. Explore Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
